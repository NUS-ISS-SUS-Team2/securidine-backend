# securidine-backend
[To check if better to have one repo for all backend services or one repo per service]

Backend will be done using Springboot to manage each service's API logic.
For streamlining wise, it would be leaner to have all services feeding off one DB instead of one db each service (which may be costly also), and just secure that one DB.
